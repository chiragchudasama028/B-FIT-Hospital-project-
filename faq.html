                <h4 class=" wow fadeInLeftBig">questions of Accreditation</h4>
                <li class="q wow bounceInUp">Do reputable and responsible third-party associations accredit your hospitals?</li>
                <li class="a wow bounceInUp">All of the hospitals and healthcare centers that partner with We Care India are endorsed
                    and accredited by the Joint Commission International (JCI), which is the international arm of the
                    organization that reviews and accredits American hospitals. Their meticulous checklist reviews more
                    than 350 medical standards-from surgical hygiene and operational procedures for administering
                    anesthesia, to reviewing medical staff credentials.</li>
                <li class="q wow bounceInUp">What is the Joint Commission ?</li>
                <li class="a wow bounceInUp">Founded in 1951, The Joint Commission seeks to continuously improve the safety and quality
                    of care provided to the public through the provision of health care accreditation and related
                    services that support performance improvement in health care organizations. The Joint Commission
                    evaluates and accredits nearly 15,000 health care organizations and programs in the United States,
                    including more than 8,000 hospitals and home care organizations, and more than 6,800 other health
                    care organizations that provide long term care, assisted living, behavioral health care, laboratory
                    and ambulatory care services.</li>

                <li class="q wow bounceInUp">How does the Joint Commission certify a staffing agency ?</li>
                <li class="a wow bounceInUp">The Joint Commission’s Health Care Staffing Services (HCSS) Certification Program provides
                    an independent, comprehensive evaluation of a staffing firm’s ability to provide qualified and
                    competent staffing services. The review focuses on a firm’s ability to provide competent staffing
                    services and evaluates performance, continuing education and training, placement criteria, and other
                    areas.</li>

                <li class="q wow bounceInUp">What does it mean to be Joint Commission certified ?</li>
                <li class="a wow bounceInUp">When a healthcare staffing firm, such as Job2Career, becomes Joint Commission certified,
                    it goes through a lengthy process to determine if the company complies with set stringent standards.
                    These standards and practices are measured in a sound statistical manner. A company must demonstrate
                    that it adheres to all applicable laws, regulations, statues and other regulatory authorities and
                    that the company has firmly established internal policies and procedures that support these
                    practices. These rigorous standards are imposed and maintained to continually improve the safety and
                    quality of care delivered to patients.</li>

                <li class="q wow bounceInUp">What does the Joint Commission certification mean for Clients ?</li>
                <li class="a wow bounceInUp">When you chose Job2Career, you can be confident that the services offered by our company
                    have been assessed and approved by the Joint Commission. Our continual goal is to provide the
                    highest quality of patient care to the community and offer excellence in customer service to our
                    clients. We hope that our Joint Commission Certification proves our commitment to these principles.

                <h4 class=" wow fadeInLeftBig">Cost Savings, Insurance and Payment</h4>


                <li class="q wow bounceInUp">How much will I save when I have an operation in India, and why does it cost so much less?
                </li>
                <li class="a wow bounceInUp">Generally, the cost of medical treatment provided by We Care India is 70-80% less than the
                    fees typically charged in the U.S. The costs incurred by frivolous lawsuits here in the U.S. result
                    in the unusually high fee of malpractice insurance as compared to the rest of the world.

                    The Indian system is completely different. For one, India's malpractice lawsuits are not as high as
                    in the U.S because of their consistently high quality standards. What's more, Indian hospitals are
                    accustomed to dealing with the needs of international patients, so they are able to provide a
                    cost-effective estimate for the procedure, including physician fees, nursing care, room and food. In
                    general, overhead costs are much less. Physicians and hospitals charge less, medications are less
                    expensive, and there are no high additional costs (such as costs incurred to protect against
                    exaggerated malpractice insurance fees).</li>


                <li class="q wow bounceInUp">What's included in the cost of care I receive through We Care India?</li>
                <li class="a wow bounceInUp">Everything is included in the package we quote when you contact us- luxury transportation
                    to and from the hospital, medical case management, the actual procedure, medicines, hospitalization,
                    and all costs incurred with onsite follow-up care. Tourism costs such as sightseeing and sipping tea
                    after a fine meal outside the Taj Mahal are not included.</li>

                <li class="q wow bounceInUp">Isn't it expensive to travel overseas for medical treatment?</li>
                <li class="a wow bounceInUp">The simple answer is no. Airlines are providing cost advantages to passengers, so much so
                    that the fee for a plane ticket to India is now becoming very competitive, even when compared to the
                    cost of travel between major U.S. cities. For example, a patient traveling from Stamford, CT would
                    find that it costs less to travel to New Delhi than to Houston, TX during the middle of the week.

                    Add to this the fact that heart surgery would be $7-$10,000 rather than $150 - $200,000, and you can
                    see why medical travel is a growing industry that is saving hundreds of thousands for American
                    patients and hundreds of millions of dollars each year for the US country and insurance agencies
                    nationwide.</li>

                <li class="q wow bounceInUp">Can my HMO pay for my medical procedure?</li>
                <li class="a wow bounceInUp">You will need to check with your HMO regarding the medical organisations they tieup with.
                </li>

                <li class="q wow bounceInUp"> Can I pay online for my reservation?</li>
                <li class="a wow bounceInUp">You can use our online payment gateway. to pay online. Our email address for Paypal
                    payments is: info@wecareindia.com</li>

                <h4 class="wow fadeInLeftBig">Doctors and Staff</h4>
                <li class="q wow bounceInUp"> Are the doctors and surgeons in your hospitals licensed and credentialed ?</li>
                <li class="a wow bounceInUp">All of our physicians and nurses are fully licensed to practice their specialty in India.
                    Many are even Board Certified in their specialty from the US, as well as in Europe. India's
                    credentialing process is stringent, requiring a formal review of each doctor and nurse's
                    qualifications and track record.

                    These reviews are conducted long before a doctor or surgeon is appointed to the medical staff. Once
                    appointed, they are reviewed again periodically to ensure only the highest standards of practice and
                    care. When you contact our office, you may ask for a summary of each physician's qualifications.

                    If you would like to review the qualifications or specific experience of your physician in more
                    detail when you arrive we can arrange this as well. We are all too happy to address any of your
                    questions or concerns regarding your procedure before you make the decision to schedule your visit.
                </li>

                <li class="q wow bounceInUp">What type of licensing do your hospital's nurses, dieticians, pharmacists, imaging and lab
                    technicians receive?</li>
                <li class="a wow bounceInUp">Nurses, pharmacists, imaging and lab technicians are required to attend accredited schools
                    and pass detailed certification exams to obtain licenses to practice in India. Nurses are usually
                    re-certified at 5-year intervals. Medical staff with special responsibilities must receive
                    specialized training and are certified as competent in the areas of their specialization (such as
                    ICU or Intensive Care Unit).</li>

                <li class="q wow bounceInUp">Are my doctors and surgeons and nurses able to speak to me in English ?</li>
                <li class="a wow bounceInUp">English is widely spoken in India, as well as in and around our hospitals. There are over
                    80 different Indian dialects, and the only way the Indians can speak to each other is through
                    English. You will be able to communicate in English with all of your doctors, surgeons, nurses and
                    many of the medical staff. We also employ close to 70 interpreters to help patients coming from the
                    U.S. who speak languages other than English.</li>

                <li class="q wow bounceInUp">Can I become familiar with my overseas physician before I go for treatment ?</li>
                <li class="a wow bounceInUp">We at WE CARE INDIA ensure you get to talk to your physician even before we set up a
                    favorable all-inclusive package for your medical trip. We arrange a conference call with you and
                    your personal physician who will be treating you and looking after your recovery. He might request
                    medical records to be mailed.

                    If you're going for permanent weight loss, knee replacement, cosmetic surgery, etc., your doctor
                    might require pictures of the areas in need so you both can agree on the right treatment for you. We
                    at WE CARE INDIA want you to make sure you know the exact procedure you'll be experiencing, how long
                    it will take to recover in the hospital and the guesthouse before you come back home.</li>

                <li class="q wow bounceInUp"> Do We Care India doctors have U.S. Board certifications ?</li>
                <li class="a wow bounceInUp">Definitely yes, and more. At We Care India, you get more than just a doctor to attend to
                    you, but a team of highly qualified and experienced physicians. As soon as you are admitted, we
                    assign this team to your care. This team is led by Patient Care Coordinator who is made responsible
                    and in charge of your overall care.</li>


                <h4 class="fadeInLeftBig">Medical Tourism India</h4>
                <li class="q wow bounceInUp">What is Medical Tourism ?</li>
                <li class="a wow bounceInUp">Medical tourism is also known as medical travel or health tourism and refers to a
                    rapidly-growing practice of Americans, Europeans and other citizens of developed countries traveling
                    to another country to obtain health care or services at far lower costs. Some common medical
                    procedures outsourced by Medical Tourists are complex specialized surgeries such as joint
                    replacement (knee/hip), cardiac surgery, dental surgery, and cosmetic surgeries. Most often, such
                    medical journeys include leisure and travel.</li>

                <li class="q wow bounceInUp">What are the benefits of having a medical procedure done in an offshore country that
                    offers medical tourism?</li>
                <li class="a wow bounceInUp">Cost is clearly the most important reason that patients travel many miles for a medical
                    procedure. Most of these outsourced procedures are done in Hospital at other countries at a fraction
                    of what they will cost in U.S. or European Hospital.</li>

                <li class="q wow bounceInUp">How good are specialists and physicians in the India ?</li>
                <li class="a wow bounceInUp">On the whole, Indian doctors have skills that are at par, or that even exceed, those of
                    their Western counterparts. The country’s medical school curricula are tougher than those of other
                    Asian countries.</li>

                <li class="q wow bounceInUp">Why should I travel halfway across the globe for a healthcare procedure?</li>
                <li class="a wow bounceInUp">Because it is worth it. First, you will save a lot of money—procedures at We Care India
                    cost a fraction of what they cost in your country. More, your overall healing experience is
                    guaranteed in We Care India whose people genuinely warm, caring and hospitable.</li>
                <li class="q wow bounceInUp"> India is depicted in the U.S. media as a "poor country" with poor living conditions. Is
                    it safe for me to have major medical treatment there ?</li>
                <li class="a wow bounceInUp">Because India's colleges are graduating thousands of new doctors, specialized technicians,
                    etc., each year, India has witnessed a rapidly growing working middle class, and the poverty level
                    has lessened each year within the past ten years-at a faster rate than most Asian and surrounding
                    medical vacation countries.

                    The facts are, India has one the world's most dynamic emerging economies, and for the last ten
                    years, India has become the worldwide health care destination. Governmental and private bodies have
                    made substantial investments over the years to ensure that hospital equipment and healthcare
                    facilities compare favorably with leading hospitals in the U.S. These hospitals have also attracted
                    some of the best physicians in the world.</li>

                <li class="q wow bounceInUp">Are a patient's rights to competent medical treatment protected by Indian law ?</li>
                <li class="a wow bounceInUp">All medical patients in India, and especially medical travelers who come to India
                    expecting the absolute best medical care, are fully and extraordinarily protected by Indian law,
                    codes of medical conduct, and a Patient Bill of Rights enforced by the Indian government.

                    Patients may complain directly to the Indian Medical Council or the Ministry of Public Health for
                    whatever reason they choose. These organizations are powerful entities capable of taking and
                    enforcing legal action because they grant licenses to hospitals and their doctors. It should be
                    noted that incidences of malpractice and blame are very low compared to the American healthcare
                    system.</li>
